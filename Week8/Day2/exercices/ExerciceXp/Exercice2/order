🌟 Exercise 2: Building a Basic CRUD API with Express.js
Instructions

In this exercise, you’ll build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Express.js. Your task is to create routes to manage a collection of books.

1. Create a new directory named book-api.

2. Inside the book-api directory, initialize a new Node.js project and install the express package.

3. Create a new file named app.js in the book-api directory.

4. In app.js, import the express module and create an instance of an Express app.

5. Define a basic data array containing a few book objects. Each book object should have properties like id, title, author, and publishedYear.

6. Set up the app to listen on port 5000. Print a message in the console to indicate that the server is running.

7. Implement the “Read all” route by defining a route at GET /api/books. Send a JSON response with the books array.

8. Implement the “Read” route by defining a route at GET /api/books/:bookId. Extract the bookId parameter from the URL and use it to find the corresponding book in the books array. If the book is found, send a JSON response with the book details and a status code of 200 (OK). If the book is not found, send a 404 status with a “Book not found” message.

9. Implement the “Create” route at POST /api/books. Use the express.json() middleware to parse JSON body content. Inside the route handler, create a new book object with an incremented ID and the data from the request body. Add the new book to the books array and return a JSON response with the new book and a status code of 201 (Created).
