ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1: Building a RESTful API
Instructions

Youâ€™re tasked with building a RESTful API for a blog platform.
Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete blog posts using different endpoints.

1. Create a directory named blog-api.

2. Inside the blog-api directory, open a terminal and run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

3. Install the express package by running npm install express in the terminal.

4. Create a file named server.js.

5. In server.js, require the express package and set up an Express app.

6. Create a data array to simulate a database. Each item in the array should represent a blog post with properties like id, title, and content.

7. Implement the following routes using Express:
8. GET /posts: Return a list of all blog posts.
9. GET /posts/:id: Return a specific blog post based on its id.
10. POST /posts: Create a new blog post.
11. PUT /posts/:id: Update an existing blog post.
12. DELETE /posts/:id: Delete a blog post.

13. Implement error handling for invalid routes and server errors.

14. Start the Express app and listen on a specified port (e.g., 3000).
